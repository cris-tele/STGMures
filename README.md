# STGMures Statistical project

This is a pro bono project!

The beneficiary of this project is the Tg Mures hospital, Romania,https://ibcvt.ro/.

Hospital's moto is a very simple one: "WE CARE ABOUT YOUR HEART!".

Yes, this is one of the few Romanian hospitals where newborns can be treated for heart diseases. 

So, if you want to contribute to this pro-bono project, well, I am asking for help in finalizing this endeavor. Just work & ideas.

Any piece of code, sugestion or recomandation (docs, tools...)  will be highly appreciated.

I've choose Visual Studio 2022, .NET7, C#, blazor webassembly. 

The project must be web based: one specific requirement from the medical staff, it has to be accessible both from work or from home (a heart surgery usually takes more than 8 hours, no comments...) or from another hospital ;
  
It has to be responsive, because the majority of the pages are for the anesthesia and intensive care department from this hospital. I supose the server will not be a very "big" one, so seems a good idea to put the clients at work.
  
It's better to use Microsoft core & free nugets packages (it's a public institute, buying some software = a public acquisition procedure â€¦ a nightmare);
  
Also API web assemblies looks better for future developments. Maybe some API' will be exploited by other apps / devices ;
  
I've chosen MS SQL Express  (it is free an easier for the development phase & Integrated in Visual Studio Community Edition; for the production phaseâ€¦ will see).

The project's 'requirements, well, It's an excel file, feel free to analyze it (see the dummy folder). I will also write a SRS... 

The project final scope: to create a good statistical tool for the medical staff! But for now, the project's goal is to structure and collect all the data ðŸ˜Š.
Next step: reports, graphics, pivot tables (excel?), anything that may help the medical staff in taking good decisions in short time... don't know more yet.


Thx,
Cristian.
