# STGMures Statistical project

This is a pro bono project!

The beneficiary of this project is the Tg Mures hospital, Romania,https://ibcvt.ro/.

Hospital's moto is a very simple one: "WE CARE ABOUT YOUR HEART!".

Yes, this is one of the few Romanian hospitals where newborns can be treated for heart diseases. 

So, if you want to contribute to this pro-bono project, well, I am asking for help in finalizing this endeavor. Just work & ideas.

I am not an expert in .NET C# developer, nor a very good designer. Any peace of code, advice or even recomandations (docs, tools...)  will be highly appreciated.
I am a mechanical engineer, the medical terms in this project are also very confusing. Again, any help/note to understand how the medical world work will be apreciated.

I've choose Visual Studio 2022, .NET7, C#, blazor webassembly. Only free/default nuget staff & libraries. Postman is the only useful

The project must be web based: one specific requirement from the medical staff, it has to be accessible both from work or from home (a heart surgery usually takes more than 8 hours, no comments...) ;
  
It has to be responsive, because the majority of the pages are for the anesthesia and intensive care department from this hospital. I supose the server will not be a very "big" one, so seems a good idea to put the clients at work.
  
Tt has to use Microsoft core libraries, free nugets (it's a public institute that means they have to initiate a public acquisition procedureâ€¦ a nightmare);
  
API web assemblies, MAYBE some API' will be exploted by other apps / devices (Blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, automatic dosage of substancesâ€¦ probably could be received and not entered manually; for now, itâ€™s manually ðŸ˜Š;
  
I've chosen MS SQL Express  (it is free an easier for the development phase & Integrated in Visual Studio Community Edition; for productionâ€¦ will see).

The architecture and some good ideas and also some code are from Patrick God's tutorials ðŸ˜Š. I recommend this guy.

The 'requirements', well, It's an excel file, feel free to analyze it (see the dummy folder). I will also write a SRS... 

The project final scope: to create a good statistical tool for the medical staff! 
That means graphics, pivot tables (excel?), reports, anything that may help the medical staff in taking good decisions in short time... don't know more yet, but for shore when a heart goes "offline", any fast and good info is crucil.

For now, the project's goal is to structure and collect all the data ðŸ˜Š.


Thx,
Cristian.
