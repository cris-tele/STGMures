# STGMures Statistical project

This is a pro bono project!

The beneficiary of this project is the Tg Mures hospital, Romania,https://ibcvt.ro/.

Hospital's moto is a very simple one: "WE CARE ABOUT YOUR HEART!".

Yes, this is one of the few Romanian hospitals where newborns can be treated for heart diseases. 

So, if you want to contribute to this pro-bono project, wellcome. 

I've choose Visual Studio 2022, .NET.7, C#, blazor webassembly, free nugets packages. 

The project must be web based, it has to be accessible both from work or from home or from another hospital (a heart surgery usually takes more than 8 hours, no comments...).
  
I've chose MS SQL Express  (it is free for the development phase & Integrated in Visual Studio Community Edition; for the production phaseâ€¦ will see).

The project final scope: to create a good statistical tool for the medical staff! 


Thx,
Cristian.
